Ohio Parent Hub MVP — Detailed Build Plan (Tailored to Your Repo)
What we built / strategy so far

Strategy: Build a real directory foundation first (SEO-safe URLs, server-rendered pages, data pipeline), then layer on maps + richer UI.

Done ✅

Next.js (App Router) project deployed on Vercel with custom domain (ohioparenthub.com)

SEO foundations:

app/layout.tsx metadata

app/robots.ts and app/sitemap.ts

app/icon.png favicon

URL architecture (locked):

City pages: /daycares/[city]

Daycare detail: /daycare/[slug] where slug starts with PROGRAM NUMBER

UI scaffolding:

Homepage (app/page.tsx)

Browse split layout (filters + list + map placeholder) (app/daycares/[city]/page.tsx)

Data exists in repo:

data/ohio_daycares.csv

data/daycares.json generated by scripts/buildDaycaresJson.mjs

Current issue ❌

City pages show 0 results even though JSON exists.

Root cause is almost certainly one of:

JSON not being regenerated when CSV changes (predev missing)

City normalization mismatch (spaces vs dashes vs casing)

CSV parsing dropping rows due to commas/quotes (DIY parser risk)

UI / UX TOOLING (the missing piece)
UI stack decision (free, modern, legit)

Use: Tailwind + shadcn/ui

Tailwind: you already have it installed (tailwindcss in devDependencies).

shadcn/ui: free component library built on Tailwind + Radix primitives.

Gives you instantly professional UI:

inputs, buttons, cards, dropdowns, dialogs, badges

consistent spacing + typography

This avoids “it looks like a dev project” syndrome.

Why not a paid template / WordPress theme?

You already committed to Next.js + Vercel

shadcn gets you “template-grade” quality without paying or migrating later

Copilot instruction: standardize all UI components through shadcn primitives so design stays consistent.

What’s left to do (in the correct order)
Phase 1 — Fix the data pipeline (must do before UI polish)
1.1 Replace the CSV parser (strongly recommended)

Your current buildDaycaresJson.mjs is likely fragile. Use a real parser.

Install: csv-parse

Update scripts/buildDaycaresJson.mjs to use csv-parse/sync

Always generate data/daycares.json

1.2 Ensure JSON builds on dev + build

Update package.json scripts:

add "predev": "node scripts/buildDaycaresJson.mjs"

keep "prebuild": "node scripts/buildDaycaresJson.mjs"

Acceptance test

npm run dev regenerates JSON

npm run build regenerates JSON

data/daycares.json row count matches expected (thousands)

1.3 Create a shared slug utility

Create: src/lib/slug.ts (you currently don’t have /src; you have /app at root — either create src or keep utilities in lib/ at repo root)

Functions:

slugify(text)

cityToSlug(city) converts spaces → dashes

slugToTitle(slug) converts cleveland-heights → Cleveland Heights

Phase 2 — Make city browse page show real results

File: app/daycares/[city]/page.tsx

2.1 Load JSON server-side and filter properly

Use cityToSlug(d["CITY"]) === params.city

Render first 25/50 results

Add pagination (?page=)

2.2 Replace placeholder UI with real UI components

Using shadcn:

Results: Card, Badge, Button

Filters (still placeholder): Select, Checkbox, Accordion

Search input: Input

Acceptance test

/daycares/columbus shows real rows

/daycares/cleveland-heights works too

Phase 3 — Daycare detail page wired to real data

File: app/daycare/[slug]/page.tsx

3.1 Parse slug → program number

programNumber = slug.split("-")[0]

3.2 Lookup daycare record

Find where PROGRAM NUMBER matches

Render a clean detail layout:

Title, badges (SUTQ, program type)

Address block

Contact block

License dates

Admin names

Use shadcn components so it looks legit immediately.

Phase 4 — Map (after data works)
Tool: Leaflet + react-leaflet (free)

Use OpenStreetMap tiles

No Google Maps key needed

4.1 Geocode as a script, not at runtime

Create:

data/geocoded.json keyed by Program Number

scripts/geocode.mjs:

reads daycares.json

geocodes missing addresses via Nominatim (rate limit!)

writes cache file

4.2 City page map

Show pins for geocoded entries in city results

4.3 Daycare page map

Show single pin

Phase 5 — SEO scale-up
5.1 Expand sitemap

Update app/sitemap.ts:

include city pages for all unique cities

(later) include daycare pages or use sitemap index

5.2 Add schema

City page: ItemList

Daycare page: LocalBusiness / ChildCare

Copilot “Do this next” prompts (based on your structure)
Prompt A — Implement shadcn/ui (UI system)

“Add shadcn/ui to this Next.js Tailwind project. Generate base components: Button, Input, Card, Badge, Select, Checkbox, Accordion. Create a simple app/components or components/ui structure. Refactor homepage and city browse page to use these components for consistent modern UI.”

Prompt B — Fix build script + predev

“Update scripts/buildDaycaresJson.mjs to use csv-parse/sync to robustly parse data/ohio_daycares.csv and output data/daycares.json. Update package.json scripts to run this script for both predev and prebuild. Add a shared slug utility and use it in app/daycares/[city]/page.tsx to filter properly.”

Prompt C — Wire real results

“Modify app/daycares/[city]/page.tsx to load data/daycares.json server-side, filter by city slug (spaces->dashes), render real cards with program data, and add pagination.”

Prompt D — Wire daycare detail page

“Modify app/daycare/[slug]/page.tsx to extract Program Number from slug, lookup the daycare in JSON, and render a professional detail page with sections and badges.”
